Bumba is the creator god. He was a giant in form and white in color. This story describes the creation  </p>

<p>In the beginning, Bumba was alone, darkness and water covered all the earth.</p>

<p>It would happen that Bumba came to feel an intense pain in his stomach, and then Bumba vomited
the sun, the moon, and stars. </p>

<p>The heat and light from the sun evaporated the water covering the earth, creating clouds, and after time, 
time, the dry hills emerged from the water.</p>

<p>Then Bumba vomited once more, bringing forth nine animals: the leopard, called Koy Bumba; the 
eagle, Ponga Bumba; the crocodile,</p>

<p>Ganda Bumba; the fish, Yo Bumba; the tortoise, Kono Bumba; a black leopard-like animal,</p>
<p>Nyanyi Bumba; a scarab; and a goat named Budi. Bumba also vomited many men; one of them was 
called Loko Yima and was white like Bumba.</p>

<p>These nine animals went on to create all the world's creatures. Three of Mbombo's sons then said 
they would finish creating the world.</p>

<p>The first to try, Nyonye Ngana, vomited white ants, but died after. To honor him, the ants went deep 
in the earth for dark soil</p>
<p >to bury him and transformed the barren sands at the earth's surface. The second, Chonganda, 
created the first plant,</p>
<p>which in turn gave rise to all trees, grasses and flowers. And Cheddi Bumba, the third son, made the 
last bird, the kite</p>
