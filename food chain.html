<h1>THE SUN</h1>

<font size="4">
<p>The sun is the initial source of energy, which provides energy for everything on the planet.
The Sun is the very beginning of our food chain.</p>



<p>The Sun provides the energy for plants to undergo photosynthesis, which begins the food chain.</p>

<p>Producers in a food chain or food web take the sun's light and convert it into food through photosynthesis.
<p>This group composes the largest group of organisms on Earth. Sugar results from photosynthesis,</p>

<p>wherein plants or algae take sunlight, carbon dioxide and water and produce food (sugar) and oxygen.</p>

<p>Effectively, the sun's energy triggers the beginning of the energy transfer in the food web.</p>

<h1>producers <a name="c1"></a></h1>
<img src="producers.jfif"width="400">
<br><br>
<font size="4">
<p>The producers in a food chain include all autotrophs such as phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, algae, and green plants.</p>
<p>This is the first stage in a food chain.</p>

<p>The producers make up the first level of a food chain.</p>

<p>The producers utilise the energy from the sun to make food.</p>

<p>Producers are also known as autotrophs as they make their own.</p>

<p>Producers are any plant or other organisms that produce their own nutrients through photosynthesis.</p>
</font>

<br><br>
<h1>consumers <a name="c2"></a></h1>
<img src="consumers.jfif"width="400">
<br><br>
<font size="4">
<p>Consumers are all organisms that are dependent on plants or other organisms for food.</p>

<p>This is the largest part of a food web, as it contains almost all living organisms.</p>
<p>It includes herbivores which are animals that eat plants, carnivores which are animals that eat other 
animals,</p>
<p>parasites that live on other organisms by harming them and lastly the scavengers, which are animals 
that eat dead animalsâ€™ carcasses.</p>
</font>

<br><br>

<h1>decomposers <a name="c3"></a></h1>
<img src="decomposers.jfif"width="400">
<br><br>
<font size="4">
<p>Decomposers are organisms that get energy from dead or waste organic material. This is the last 
stage in a food chain.</p>
<p>Decomposers are an integral part of a food chain, as they convert organic waste materials into 
inorganic materials,</p>
<p>which enriches the soil or land with nutrients. Decomposers complete a life cycle.</p>
<p>They help in recycling the nutrients as they provide nutrients to soil or oceans, that can be utilised by 
autotrophs or producers.</p>
<p>Thus, starting a whole new food chain.</p>
